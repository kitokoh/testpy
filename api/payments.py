# Example of how to include this router in your main FastAPI application:
# from fastapi import FastAPI
# from . import payments # Assuming payments.py is in the same directory as main.py or a sub-directory
#
# app = FastAPI()
# app.include_router(payments.router)
#
# # To run (example): uvicorn main:app --reload
#
# Note on imports:
# The import `import models` assumes that 'models.py' is in the SAME directory as 'payments.py'.
# If your project structure is:
# /app
#   /api
#     payments.py
#     models.py
#   /db
#     /cruds
#       invoices_crud.py
#   main.py
#
# And you run uvicorn from /app (e.g. uvicorn main:app), then:
# - `import models` inside payments.py might need to be `from . import models`
# - `from ..db.cruds import invoices_crud` would be correct for payments.py to access invoices_crud.py
# The current code `import models` might be problematic if `api` is not directly in PYTHONPATH.
# For robustness, `from . import models` is generally preferred if models.py is a sibling.
# I've used `import models` as per the prompt's example `from .. import models` which implies models.py is in the parent of `api/`.
# However, the prompt states `models.py is in the parent directory (api/)` which means it is a sibling of `payments.py` if `payments.py` is in `api/`.
# Let's stick to `import models` for now and assume PYTHONPATH or the execution context handles it.
# A safer bet is `from . import models` if they are in the same directory.
# I will adjust the model import to `from . import models` for typical FastAPI project structures.

# Re-adjusting based on typical structure where main.py is at project root,
# and api files are in an 'api' subfolder.
# If main.py is in /app, and payments.py is in /app/api/, and models.py is in /app/api/
# then `from . import models` is correct.
# If invoices_crud.py is in /app/db/cruds/, then `from ..db.cruds import invoices_crud` is correct.
# The initial import paths provided in the prompt were slightly ambiguous.
# The current code for `invoices_crud` import `from ..db.cruds import invoices_crud` is standard.
# For `models`, `from . import models` is more standard if `models.py` is in the same `api` directory.
# I will change `import models` to `from . import models`.
# This change is done directly in the created file block.
# The tool does not allow editing the thought process after generation, so this note serves as clarification.
# The generated code will have `from . import models`.
# The `datetime` import was added as it's good practice, though not strictly used in annotations in this file.
# Pydantic v1 vs v2: Using `model_dump()` for v2, as it's the newer standard. If the project uses v1, it should be `.dict()`.
# The CRUD functions are assumed to handle date string conversions if they store dates as strings. Pydantic models use `date` objects.
# The `list_all_invoices` filters for dates: converting date objects to ISO format strings for the CRUD.
# Added `status_code=201` for successful POST.
# Added `Path(...)` for path parameters to make them required.
# Added `Query(...)` descriptions for better OpenAPI docs.
# Corrected Pydantic v1 `.dict()` to v2 `.model_dump()`.
